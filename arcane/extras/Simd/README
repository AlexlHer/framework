This directory contains some tests to bench Simd code used by the Arcane Framework.

First, if directory 'orig' is absent, you need to create it with the command 'do_copy'.
It will copy some files from the Arcane Framework to the 'orig' directory.

After that, you can compile and run all the benches with the command:

  gmake -j4 test

If needed, you can modify the Makefile if you want to change some options or compiler.
You need a compiler with C++11 supports

You will have several binaries:

  test_avx512.exe
  test_avx.exe
  test_sse.exe
  test_emul.exe

NOTE: compiling avx512 requires a recent (post 2012) version of binutils.
For exemple, CentOS 6 is too old.

To run a specific test, simply execute the corresponding binary.

To compile for intel compile, launch the command

  gmake -j4 USE_INTEL=yes
